# CDA (COVID19 Data Aggregator) 
## Abstract

In view of the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, many people are quarantined at their homes, especially the old people and people in hotspot areas, who have limited means to get even the basic needs. In this project, we come with a solution by designing a web app, which acts as an interface between users and service providers of emergency services like ambulance, water, medical supplies, grocery supplies etc.
This can be used by the Government or NGOs in order to locate these areas and provide them the required services.

Our model can also be used to predict potential emergencies in case the situation goes out of hand, and where and in what proportion should the medical kits and other supplies be provided in case of such situations.
